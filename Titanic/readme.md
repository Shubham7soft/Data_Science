# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction
This project tackles the classic Kaggle challenge of predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. Using a historical dataset, this machine learning project builds a classification model to determine which passengers were more likely to survive the disaster based on various attributes.

# üéØ Project Goal
The primary goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the survival outcome of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. This involves analyzing passenger data to identify key features influencing survival and building a model to make accurate predictions on unseen data.

# üìä Dataset
## The project utilizes two main datasets:

## .train.csv: The training dataset, containing passenger details and their survival status.

## .test.csv: The test dataset, containing passenger details for whom survival predictions need to be made.

## .gender_submission.csv: A sample submission file showing the expected format.

## Key Features (from train.csv and test.csv):

.PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger.

.Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes). (Only in train.csv)

.Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).

.Name: Passenger's name.

.Sex: Passenger's gender.

.Age: Passenger's age in years.

.SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.

.Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.

.Ticket: Ticket number.

.Fare: Passenger fare.

.Cabin: Cabin number.

.Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries
## .Python: The core programming language.

## .Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive development and analysis.

## .Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

## .NumPy: For numerical operations.

## .Scikit-learn (Sklearn): For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

  .Classification Algorithms: (e.g., Logistic Regression, as suggested in your bullet points).

## .Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

# üß™ Methodology
The project follows a comprehensive machine learning workflow:

## 1.Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

   .Loading train.csv and test.csv datasets.

   .Initial inspection of data types, missing values, and summary statistics.

## 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   .Analyzing survival rates based on various features like Sex, Pclass, Age, and Embarked.

   .Visualizing distributions and relationships using histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps.

## 3.Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:

   .Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing Age values (e.g., based on Sex and Pclass groupings) and Fare (e.g., with its median).

   .Feature Engineering: Creating new, more informative features such as FamilySize (from SibSp and Parch).

   .Categorical Feature Encoding: Converting categorical variables (Sex, Embarked) into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.

   .Dropping irrelevant features (e.g., Name, Ticket, Cabin if not engineered).

## 4.Model Building and Evaluation:

   .Splitting the train.csv data into training and validation sets.

   .Implementing and training a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression).

   .Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

   .Generating predictions on the test.csv dataset.

# ‚ú® Key Findings
.Gender and Pclass were identified as highly significant predictors of survival.

.Age also played a role, with children having a higher survival rate.

.The project successfully demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for a classification task, from raw data to a predictive model.
