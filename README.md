üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies & Libraries
My proficiency has been developed through consistent engagement with the following key tools and libraries:

Python: The primary programming language underpinning all analytical and model development efforts.

Jupyter Notebooks: Employed for interactive development, data exploration, and structured presentation of analytical workflows.

NumPy: Utilized for high-performance numerical operations and array manipulation.

Pandas: Applied extensively for data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and in-depth analysis.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed for generating diverse statistical and exploratory data visualizations.

Scikit-learn (Sklearn): Leveraged for implementing a wide array of machine learning algorithms.

Anaconda: The distribution used for efficient package and environment management.

SQL: A foundational understanding of relational database querying and management.

üìÇ Featured Projects
üìä Data Analysis with NumPy & Pandas
Broadcasting.ipynb: Explores NumPy's broadcasting mechanics, crucial for efficient array arithmetic across varying dimensions.

data_type.ipynb: Investigates and manipulates NumPy array data types, fundamental for memory optimization and computational accuracy.

Inde_slic.ipynb: Illustrates advanced NumPy indexing and slicing strategies for precise data access and modification.

üìà Data Visualization
Notebooks such as lung-cancer-prediction.ipynb and Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb showcase the application of matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn for:

Histograms to analyze data distributions.

Box plots for identifying outliers and understanding data spread.

A variety of plots for comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA).

ü§ñ Machine Learning Applications
1. Lung Cancer Prediction üè•
lung_cancer.csv: The dataset used for developing a predictive model for lung cancer.

lung-cancer-prediction.ipynb: This project encompasses:

Data Acquisition & Initial Assessment: Loading and preliminary examination of the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Addressing missing values, encoding categorical features, and managing outliers (e.g., using the Interquartile Range for 'AGE').

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions and their correlation with lung cancer incidence.

Model Development & Evaluation: Training and assessing machine learning models, with a critical emphasis on recall for class 1 to minimize false negatives in medical diagnostics.

2. Titanic Survival Prediction üö¢
train.csv, test.csv, gender_submission.csv: Standard datasets for the Kaggle Titanic survival prediction challenge.

Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb: This machine learning pipeline includes:

Data Ingestion: Loading training and testing datasets using Pandas.

Feature Engineering: Deriving new features, such as survival rates based on demographic and passenger class attributes.

Missing Value Imputation: Strategic handling of missing 'Age' values (imputation based on 'Sex' and 'Embarked' groupings) and 'Fare' (median imputation).

Categorical Feature Encoding: Transformation of nominal features ('Sex', 'Embarked') into numerical representations via one-hot encoding.

Model Training & Prediction: Application of machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival.

3. Foundational ML Algorithm üçéüçä
firstml_algo.ipynb: This notebook introduces a fundamental Scikit-learn Decision Tree Classifier, illustrating key machine learning steps:

Defining feature sets and corresponding labels for classification.

Instantiating and training a basic classification model.

Executing predictions using the trained model.
